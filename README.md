## Description
- What was your motivation? What motivated me was to build a easy to navigate site where users could create their own posts and add comments to others. For trying to build something like this really took a step further and for me I wanted to give myself a real challenge.

- Why did you build this project? I built this module to further enhance my knowledge of MVC. It was a great way to try and implement the ability to sign up and log in, both that are so commonly used. However, while I wasn't able to get it to function properly it was still a great way to work with it.

- What problem does it solve? This module didn't really solve a problem but create a blog wesbite in a simple and user friendly way.

- What did you learn? For this module I learned that there are so many files, packages and routes required for building a wesbsite like the one that was being asked. As I stated above, I was able to further enhance my knowledge of MVC which was something I was really struggling with.
